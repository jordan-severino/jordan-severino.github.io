      <h1> About me</h1>
     <p>This is my very first experiment with coding on any platform.
      I became originally interested in computer engineering in highschool and switched majors my sophmore year.<br>
       This was inspired by my childhoods best friend's father, who works in the computer science field for a number of different companys in web development.<br>
       The software/Coding aspect of computers interested my more than hardware which convinced me to switch my major the fall semester of 2021!<br>
        My other hobbies include, but are not limited to, Sand/Indoor Volleyball, Track, Piano, Gaming, swimming, and coaching.
