      <h1> My Java Script</h1>
     <p>This is my very first experiment with coding on any platform.
      I became originally interested in computer engineering in highschool and switched majors my sophmore year. 
       This was inspired by my childhoods best friend's father, who works in the computer science field for a number of different companys in web development.
       The software/Coding aspect of computers interested my more than hardware which convinced me to switch my major the fall semester of 2021.
